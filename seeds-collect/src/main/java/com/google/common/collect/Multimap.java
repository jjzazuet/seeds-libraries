/**
 * A collection that maps keys to values, similar to {@link Map}, but in which
 * each key may be associated with <i>multiple</i> values. You can visualize the
 * contents of a multimap either as a map from keys to <i>nonempty</i>
 * collections of values:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>a → 1, 2
 * <li>b → 3
 * </ul>
 *
 * ... or as a single "flattened" collection of key-value pairs:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>a → 1
 * <li>a → 2
 * <li>b → 3
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Important:</b> although the first interpretation resembles how most
 * multimaps are <i>implemented</i>, the design of the {@code Multimap} API is
 * based on the <i>second</i> form. So, using the multimap shown above as an
 * example, the {@link #size} is {@code 3}, not {@code 2}, and the {@link
 * #values} collection is {@code [1, 2, 3]}, not {@code [[1, 2], [3]]}. For
 * those times when the first style is more useful, use the multimap's {@link
 * #asMap} view (or create a {@code Map<K, Collection<V>>} in the first place).
 *
 * <h3>Example</h3>
 *
 * <p>The following code: <pre>   {@code
 *
 *   ListMultimap<String, String> multimap = ArrayListMultimap.create();
 *   for (President pres : US_PRESIDENTS_IN_ORDER) {
 *     multimap.put(pres.firstName(), pres.lastName());
 *   }
 *   for (String firstName : multimap.keySet()) {
 *     List<String> lastNames = multimap.get(firstName);
 *     out.println(firstName + ": " + lastNames);
 *   }}</pre>
 *
 * ... produces output such as: <pre>   {@code
 *
 *   Zachary: [Taylor]
 *   John: [Adams, Adams, Tyler, Kennedy]
 *   George: [Washington, Bush, Bush]
 *   Grover: [Cleveland]
 *   ...}</pre>
 *
 * <h3>Views</h3>
 *
 * <p>Much of the power of the multimap API comes from the <i>view
 * collections</i> it provides. These always reflect the latest state of the
 * multimap itself. When they support modification, the changes are
 * <i>write-through</i> (they automatically update the backing multimap). These
 * view collections are:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #asMap}, mentioned above</li>
 * <li>{@link #keys}, {@link #keySet}, {@link #values}, {@link #entries}, which
 *     are similar to the corresponding view collections of {@link Map}
 * <li>and, notably, even the collection returned by {@link #get get(key)} is an
 *     active view of the values corresponding to {@code key}
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The collections returned by the {@link #replaceValues replaceValues} and
 * {@link #removeAll removeAll} methods, which contain values that have just
 * been removed from the multimap, are naturally <i>not</i> views.
 *
 * <h3>Subinterfaces</h3>
 *
 * <p>Instead of using the {@code Multimap} interface directly, prefer the
 * subinterfaces {@link ListMultimap} and {@link SetMultimap}. These take their
 * names from the fact that the collections they return from {@code get} behave
 * like (and, of course, implement) {@link List} and {@link Set}, respectively.
 *
 * <p>For example, the "presidents" code snippet above used a {@code
 * ListMultimap}; if it had used a {@code SetMultimap} instead, two presidents
 * would have vanished, and last names might or might not appear in
 * chronological order.
 *
 * <p><b>Warning:</b> instances of type {@code Multimap} may not implement
 * {@link Object#equals} in the way you expect (multimaps containing the same
 * key-value pairs, even in the same order, may or may not be equal). The
 * recommended subinterfaces provide a much stronger guarantee.
 *
 * <h3>Comparison to a map of collections</h3>
 *
 * <p>Multimaps are commonly used in places where a {@code Map<K,
 * Collection<V>>} would otherwise have appeared. The differences include:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>There is no need to populate an empty collection before adding an entry
 *     with {@link #put put}.
 * <li>{@code get} never returns {@code null}, only an empty collection.
 * <li>A key contained in the multimap always maps to at least one value. Any
 *     operation that causes a key to have zero associated values has the effect
 *     of <i>removing</i> that key from the multimap.
 * <li>The total entry count is available as {@link #size}.
 * <li>Many complex operations become easier; for example, {@code
 *     Collections.min(multimap.values())} finds the smallest value across all
 *     keys.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Implementations</h3>
 *
 * <p>As always, prefer the immutable implementations, {@link
 * ImmutableListMultimap} and {@link ImmutableSetMultimap}. General-purpose
 * mutable implementations are listed above under "All Known Implementing
 * Classes". You can also create a <i>custom</i> multimap, backed by any {@code
 * Map} and {@link Collection} types, using the {@link Multimaps#newMultimap
 * Multimaps.newMultimap} family of methods. Finally, another popular way to
 * obtain a multimap is using {@link Multimaps#index Multimaps.index}. See
 * the {@link Multimaps} class for these and other static utilities related
 * to multimaps.
 *
 * <h3>Other Notes</h3>
 *
 * <p>All methods that modify the multimap are optional. The view collections
 * returned by the multimap may or may not be modifiable. Any modification
 * method that is not supported will throw {@link
 * UnsupportedOperationException}.
 *
 * <p>See the Guava User Guide article on <a href=
 * "http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/NewCollectionTypesExplained#Multimap">
 * {@code Multimap}</a>.
