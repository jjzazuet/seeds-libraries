/**
 * <p>A thread-safe queue of listeners, each with an associated {@code Executor}, that guarantees 
 * that every {@code Runnable} that is {@linkplain #add added} will be 
 * {@link Executor#execute(Runnable) executed} in the same order that it was added and also that 
 * execution is delayed until the next call to {@link #execute}.  This is particularly useful if
 * you need to ensure that listeners are <em>not</em> executed with a lock held. 
 * 
 * <p>While similar, this is different than {@link ExecutionList} which makes much looser guarantees
 * around ordering and has a notion of state (the executed bit) that this class does not have.
 * 
 * <p>Listeners are queued by calling {@link #add} and flushed on calls to {@link #execute()}. 
 * Because calls to {@link #add} may be concurrent with calls to {@link #execute} there is no 
 * guarantee that the queue will be empty after calling {@link #execute}.
 *
 * <p>Exceptions thrown by a listener will be propagated up to the executor. Any exception thrown 
 * during {@code Executor.execute} (e.g., a {@code RejectedExecutionException} or an exception 
 * thrown by {@linkplain MoreExecutors#sameThreadExecutor inline execution}) will be caught and
 * logged.
