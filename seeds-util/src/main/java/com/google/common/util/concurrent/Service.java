/**
 * An object with an operational state, plus asynchronous {@link #start()} and {@link #stop()}
 * lifecycle methods to transition between states. Example services include webservers, RPC servers
 * and timers.
 *
 * <p>The normal lifecycle of a service is:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@linkplain State#NEW NEW} -&gt;
 *   <li>{@linkplain State#STARTING STARTING} -&gt;
 *   <li>{@linkplain State#RUNNING RUNNING} -&gt;
 *   <li>{@linkplain State#STOPPING STOPPING} -&gt;
 *   <li>{@linkplain State#TERMINATED TERMINATED}
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>There are deviations from this if there are failures or if {@link Service#stop} is called 
 * before the {@link Service} reaches the {@linkplain State#RUNNING RUNNING} state. The set of legal
 * transitions form a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">DAG</a>, 
 * therefore every method of the listener will be called at most once. N.B. The {@link State#FAILED}
 * and {@link State#TERMINATED} states are terminal states, once a service enters either of these
 * states it cannot ever leave them.
 *
 * <p>Implementors of this interface are strongly encouraged to extend one of the abstract classes 
 * in this package which implement this interface and make the threading and state management 
 * easier.
